# Sherko Pharma — Development Status

Updated: 2026-09-27
Task record: SP-019 / Issue #50 adds scanner visual feedback and success sound. SP-018 / Issue #48 remains the compact scanner baseline. OPS-001 / Issue #42 retires hosted GitHub Actions and mandatory CI gates.
Status: SP-019 adds transient color feedback and a dependency-free system success click without changing scan lookup, camera zoom, repeat gating, or order semantics. SP-014 remains deferred. Current verification policy is owner-local after pull; hosted CI is retired.

## Verified baseline

- The latest functional feature baseline is SP-013 merge `2f00898ff7cdeb5060c215c6997c62fe5791bd26` from PR #30; later documentation-only handoff commits do not change application behavior.
- SP-000 through SP-013 and CI-001 are merged.
- Issue #29 is closed as completed and PR #30 is merged; post-merge CI run `36250531971` passed Change scope, Quality, Schema, Android build, Windows build, and Required verification.
- No open Issue or PR existed immediately before SP-012 was authorized.
- The dedicated Sherko Pharma Supabase project is active on the Free plan.
- Hosted migrations `sp003_product_schema`, `sp004_owner_catalog_api`, and `sp008_idempotent_catalog_create` are deployed.
- The approved corrected source catalog was imported and verified at exactly 23,750 imported rows, 23,750 distinct source IDs, and zero remaining manual rows.
- Import anomaly counts remain consistent with the approved source: 423 zero-price rows, 8,260 blank primary barcodes, and 22,495 blank secondary barcodes.

## SP-019 scanner feedback contract

- Keep SP-018 compact layout and SP-017 continuous scanning, one-RPC lookup and repeat-frame protection unchanged.
- Scanner guide states: white while ready, amber while checking, green after a successful add/increment, and red for non-mutating scan failures.
- Success/error guide colors are transient and return to the idle white state after 650 ms.
- Play Flutter's platform `SystemSoundType.click` only after `added` or `incremented`; sound feedback is best-effort and never blocks scanning.
- Do not add an audio dependency or bundled audio asset for this task.
- Keep Android `autoZoom: true` and tap-to-focus unchanged.
- Real-device sound behavior and visual timing remain owner verification after pull/merge.

## SP-018 compact scanner UI contract

- Keep SP-017 continuous scanning, one-RPC lookup, repeat-frame protection and order semantics unchanged.
- Reduce the camera preview from the prior 160 px panel to a compact 112 px strip with minimal outer padding and no separate scanner title row.
- Keep the close action overlaid on the preview and the result/checking status to one compact line.
- Make the overlay explicitly fill the complete camera preview before painting the guide so its coordinate system matches the scan window.
- Use a smaller centered guide capped at 300 px wide and 58 px high; update the internal scan window on every actual geometry change instead of applying a threshold.
- Compact the mobile Order header into one title/totals row plus one side-by-side actions row, and reduce mobile order-row padding/control sizes so scanned items stay visible.
- Real-device visual alignment remains owner verification after pull/merge.

## SP-017 continuous scanner contract

- One Android Scan action opens a compact inline scanner on the Order page; successful scans do not navigate away or require reopening the camera.
- The camera overlay is visual only; the instructional tip text is removed.
- A unique barcode is resolved by one owner-authorized `catalog_lookup_barcode` call. The lookup already returns the current complete product snapshot needed for order capture, so the immediate second `catalog_get` round-trip is removed.
- The camera remains active while server checking runs. A presentation gate suppresses the same code while it remains visible and unlocks it after it has been absent long enough, allowing a deliberate later presentation to increment quantity.
- Order reset/session replacement advances an order mutation generation; a barcode lookup started against an older generation is discarded before it can mutate the new/restored order.
- Unknown, ambiguous, invalid-price, overflow, permission, network and camera states remain non-destructive.
- Real-device throughput, framing and repeat-scan behavior remain owner verification after pull/merge.

## SP-016 scanner refinement contract

- Keep the existing exact barcode identity, ambiguity, authoritative catalog re-read, order mutation, and deliberate-repeat behavior unchanged.
- Show a centered horizontal barcode guide and use the same rectangle as the actual scanner scan window.
- Keep throttled `DetectionSpeed.normal` behavior while reducing the camera-side detection timeout from 250 ms to 100 ms.
- Enable Android-supported auto zoom and tap-to-focus without restricting the accepted barcode formats.
- Pause frame analysis after the first accepted capture so retries can rearm the existing camera session quickly while repeated frames remain blocked.
- Real-device responsiveness and framing remain owner verification after pull/merge.

## SP-015 delivery contract

- Preserve the implemented SP-000 through SP-013 product behavior while preparing release-mode Android and Windows candidates.
- Android identity is `com.samo.sherkopharma`; release builds must not fall back to the Flutter debug key.
- Production signing material remains outside Git.
- Windows release packaging covers the complete runner bundle; no production code-signing claim is made without an external certificate.
- Hosted CI is retired. Owner-controlled local builds, packaging, checksums, signing, runtime configuration and testing follow `RELEASE.md` and `QUALITY.md`.
- The acceptance matrix in `DELIVERY_ACCEPTANCE.md` records deferred SP-014 and the remaining owner-only actions before public distribution.

## SP-013 contract

- Android camera scanning resolves complete barcode text through the existing bounded owner-authorized catalog API.
- Match either approved barcode field, preserve leading zeroes, deduplicate the same product identity, and reject ambiguous distinct-product matches.
- SP-013 originally re-read the resolved product with `catalog_get`; SP-017 supersedes that extra round-trip because `catalog_lookup_barcode` itself is owner-authorized and returns the complete current product snapshot used for order capture.
- Repeated frames from one physical presentation must not increment quantity; a deliberate later scan can increment the existing line.
- Unknown, ambiguous, invalid-price, permission, and camera interruption states are non-destructive and recoverable.
- No Windows reader integration, inventory, checkout/history, cloud order sync, full catalog cache, or production release work belongs to SP-013.

## Implementation state

- Added an Android-only order Scan action backed by `mobile_scanner`, pinned to a reviewed upstream commit in the application lockfile.
- Added exact `catalog_lookup_barcode` repository access without direct product-table reads or a new backend migration.
- Barcode lookup preserves the scanned string, deduplicates results by product ID, and treats multiple distinct product matches as ambiguous.
- The scan controller is single-flight and delegates the server lookup snapshot to the existing order controller for price/currency/overflow rules; SP-017 removes the redundant immediate `catalog_get`.
- SP-017 keeps the camera in a compact inline Order-page panel for continuous scanning. The same visible barcode is suppressed until it leaves the frame long enough to count as a new presentation.
- Scanner lifecycle handling stops the camera while inactive and only resumes an uncommitted scan after the app returns active.
- Android camera permission is declared without making camera hardware a required installation feature.

## Verification policy

Requirement-derived tests remain in the repository and can be run locally when useful. The owner explicitly reported the real Android camera test as PASS on 2026-09-26. Historical CI evidence from earlier completed tasks remains part of Git history, but it is no longer a current merge or completion requirement.

Under OPS-001, the owner pulls/tests revisions locally and reports problems for bounded follow-up fixes. Future SP-014 work still requires fresh owner authorization and selected hardware/input-mode evidence.
